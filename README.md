TuiPath (Tuition Management System)

TuiPath is a simple computer program made to help manage tuition classes. In many schools and colleges, students take extra classes after their regular school hours. Usually, these classes are not managed well. Teachers and students often face problems with keeping track of schedules and who is in which class.

TuiPath provides a pathway to organized learning. It makes the process easy for everyone involved.



I) Main Parts of the System

The system has three main modules:

Admin: This person manages the overall system and the user details.

Teacher: Teachers can create tuition classes.

Student: Students can browse the available classes and enroll in the ones they like and need.




II) Why I Made This

I created this as a project for my 2nd semester at Kathmandu University. Right now, it is a sample to show how high schools can manage tuitions alongside regular classes. In the future, this same concept can be improved to work for large tuition centers, schools, and colleges.




III)Tools I Used

To build this project, I used:

C++: The main programming language.

Qt Framework: To create the buttons, windows, and visual design.

Sqlite: A simple database to save all the information like userdetails, tuition classes ,enrollments etc.
